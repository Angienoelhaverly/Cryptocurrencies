# Cryptocurrencies
## Project Overview
Create an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. We will thus create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data we will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we have decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. We will then use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.

* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
